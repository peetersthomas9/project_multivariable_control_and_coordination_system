# project_multivariable_control_and_coordination_system

In this project, the goal is to design an LQR controller and apply them to our path tracking
problem. The general idea is using the discrete-time linear model of the system to design
an LQR controller that will be used to control the nonlinear system. Then, the LQR will
be complemented with an observer that will use the model of the system to reconstruct one
non-measured state.
